# Efficient Learning

Some may have heard of this, but there are strategies to help you learn faster. Often people will sell a course to teach you how to acquire this skill. But over here, I'm simply giving it away because I like to be surrounded by smart people.

## Everyone learns in different ways, then which one is the best?
Yes, that is correct. Some people find it easier when listening, and some people prefer reading. Some people figure that the best way for them to learn is through interaction. The answer is all of them. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to learning. Sometimes, it depends on what you're trying to learn too. You just have to try them out one by one or combine a few together. Here I'll list a few learning strategies so you can try them out yourself. Knowledge-based information
Among all things knowledge seems to be the one thing people need to learn the most. It can be language vocabulary, code rules, terminology within your field of expertise, a recipe, a set of instructions... knowledge. 
For this type of data, you could read a book and write down a list of words you don't know.

### Write it down multiple times until you feel like you remember it.
When you write things down, multiple neurons in your brain that fire up at the same time. This creates a chain of neurons that sort of activates when you recall this information. This is referred to as muscle memory.

### Rephrase what you've just learned.
This is something you acquire when you learn about plagiarism and how to cite other people's work. Kinda like a nice bonus when you give credits where it is due. When you rephrase something, your brain makes sense of it, redescribing what you've just learned in a language of your own. One with which your mind is familiar. 

### And teach others about it
This is kind of like rephrasing but you have to put a bit of work into it.
