## Introduction

Welcome to the Backend Web Developer Road Map! This road map is designed to help you become a successful backend web developer in four years. It will provide you with the necessary skills and knowledge to become a successful backend web developer.

## What is a Backend Web Developer?

A backend web developer is a software engineer who specializes in developing the back-end of web applications. They are responsible for creating the server-side logic and database structure that powers the web application. They also work closely with front-end developers to ensure that the user experience is optimized.
That may sound like a mouthful so here's a skim-down version of that.

A backend web developer is like a librarian. We store books (data) on the shelves (database, cache, or wherever you can). When a client comes in, we tell them which shelves to look at for their books. How fast they can find their books depends on our ability. We could be a terrible librarian who can never help them find their books or we could be the librarian from hell who tells the client that they need to climb 4 mountains before they can dig the book from the back of their garden. It is up to us. 

## What Skills Do I Need?

To become a successful backend web developer, you will need to have a strong understanding of programming languages. Anything will do but I recommend ones that are more popular to get started. Because chances are someone has already run into one of your problems. You will also need to be familiar with databases such as SQL(MySQL, Postgres...) and NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB). Additionally, you should have a good understanding of data structure, code complexity, HTTP protocol, exception handling, indexing, etc... 

## What Education Do I Need?

To become a successful backend web developer, you do not need to have a degree in computer science or a related field. What you need is a mindset: 

  - Now is better than never   
  - Perfect your craft at any chance you can get
  - Always come prepared

You may also want to consider taking courses in boot camp, web development, software engineering, and database management.

## What Experience Do I Need?

This is hard to tell. I recall back in the day when I was volunteering at the library, I saw a man who had trouble using the library's website. He typed with not two but only one finger at a time. Of course, he's oblivious to hotkeys like enter and escape. I'm not saying it's something to look down on, life happens, and not everyone is born with a chance to use a computer. 

To sum it up, if you know how to use google, you're probably fine. 

## What Resources Are Available?

There are many resources available to help you become a successful backend web developer. You can find tutorials, books, and online courses to help you learn the necessary skills. Additionally, there are many online communities where you can ask questions and get advice from experienced developers.

## Conclusion

There is no conclusion because I haven't found one yet.
