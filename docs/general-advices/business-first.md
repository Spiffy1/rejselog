# Why We Should Consider Business First as a Programmer

As a programmer, it can be easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of your work. You may be focused on writing clean, efficient code or implementing the latest technologies, without considering the business context in which your work will be used. However, it's important to remember that programming is not just an end in itself, but a means to an end. The ultimate goal of programming is to create software solutions that meet the needs of businesses and users. In this essay, we'll explore why we should consider business first as programmers, and how doing so can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.

## Understanding the Business Context

One of the most important reasons to consider business first as a programmer is to ensure that the software you create is aligned with the needs and goals of the business. This requires understanding the business context in which your software will be used. You need to understand the business model, the target audience, the competitive landscape, and the broader industry trends. By understanding these factors, you can create software that meets the specific needs of the business, rather than simply creating something that you think is technically impressive.

For example, suppose you're working on a mobile app for a retail company. If you don't understand the business context, you may focus on creating flashy animations or implementing cutting-edge technologies, without considering the user experience or the specific needs of the retail company. However, if you take the time to understand the business context, you may realize that the most important thing is to create an app that's easy to use, with a simple checkout process and personalized recommendations. By putting the business first, you can create software that truly meets the needs of the business and its customers.

## Prioritizing Business Needs

Another reason to consider business first as a programmer is to ensure that you're prioritizing the most important business needs. In many cases, there may be competing priorities, such as performance, security, scalability, and usability. By understanding the business context, you can make informed decisions about which priorities to focus on, based on the business goals and user needs.

For example, if you're working on a financial application, security may be the top priority, even if it means sacrificing some performance or usability. On the other hand, if you're working on a social media app, usability and scalability may be more important, as users will quickly abandon an app that's difficult to use or slow to load. By prioritizing business needs, you can create software that's not only technically sound, but also meets the most important needs of the business and its users.

## Building Long-Term Relationships

Finally, considering business first as a programmer can help you build long-term relationships with clients and employers. By creating software that meets the specific needs of the business, you can demonstrate your value as a strategic partner, rather than just a technical resource. This can lead to more opportunities for collaboration and growth, as well as more job security and satisfaction.

For example, suppose you're working as a freelance developer for a small business. By understanding the business context and prioritizing the most important business needs, you can create software that helps the business grow and thrive. This can lead to more work and referrals from the business, as well as a long-term relationship that benefits both parties.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, considering business first as a programmer is essential for creating software solutions that truly meet the needs of businesses and users. By understanding the business context, prioritizing business needs, and building long-term relationships, you can create software that's not only technically sound, but also aligned with the goals and values of the business. By putting the business first, you can become a strategic partner and valuable asset to any organization or client.
