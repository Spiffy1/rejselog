# About This

Hi, thank you for your patronage.

This is very much a note book where I organized the information I acquired through out my career as a software engineer.
Everyone started out differently and explains things in their own ways. Some suffer from the curse of knowledge. I too once did.
At the moment, this notebook will focus on the road map toward a backend developer. I've been in the business for 3 years so. 
As a wise man once said, to make a millions mistake one after another is to learn a millions different things one after another. 
The same thing is not true if you repeat the same mistake a millions times. And I'm here to avoid that from happening, to us.
