# About This Book

Hi, thank you for your patronage.

This is very much a notebook where I organized the information I acquired throughout my career as a software engineer.
Everyone started differently and explains things in their way. Some suffer from the curse of knowledge. I too once did and probably still is.
At the moment, this notebook will focus on the road map toward a backend developer. I've been in the business since 2019.
As a wise man once said, to make a million mistakes one after another is to learn a million different things one after another. 
The same thing is not true if you repeat the same mistake a million times. And I'm here to prevent that from happening... to you.
