## Intro
Welcome to My Personal Backend Development Documentation

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Phan, and I am a backend developer who started their journey in 2019. Welcome to my personal documentation page, where I document my learning process and best practices. Everyone started differently and explains things in their way. Some suffer from the curse of knowledge. I too once did and probably still is.

As a wise man once said, to make a million mistakes one after another is to learn a million different things one after another. 

The same thing is not true if you repeat the same mistake a million times. And I'm here to prevent that from happening... to you. 

Here, you will find a collection of articles, code snippets, and tutorials that I have created and curated throughout my development journey. From tips and tricks to troubleshooting guides, I hope that this documentation will be a valuable resource for fellow developers and anyone interested in learning more about backend development.

Resje is nordic for travel.

## Why I Created This Documentation

As a developer, I believe that the learning process is ongoing and that there is always room for improvement. By documenting my development journey, I hope to keep track of my progress, learn from my mistakes, and share my knowledge with others.

* Version control & managing packages
* Improving code quality in a semi-automatic way with lots of suggestions

I suggest going from the road map section, figuring out where you are and then going from there. These docs also have a built-in search engine so it should make your life easier.
