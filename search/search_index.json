They also work closely with front-end developers to ensure that the user experience is optimized. That may sound like a mouthful so here's a skim-down version of that.</p> <p>A backend web developer is like a librarian. We store books (data) on the shelves (database, cache, or wherever you can). When a client comes in, we tell them which shelves to look at for their books. How fast they can find their books depends on our ability. We could be a terrible librarian who can never help them find their books or we could be the librarian from hell who tells the client that they need to climb 4 mountains before they can dig the book from the back of their garden.

In Python, there are many ways to work smart, and here's a simple example:</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/automaton/#example","title":"Example","text":"<p>Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to find the sum of all the even numbers in the list. One way to do this would be to iterate over the list, check each number to see if it's even, and add it to a running total if it is. Here's some code that would do that:</p> <pre><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ntotal = 0\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        total += num\nprint(total)\n</code></pre> <p>This code works fine, but it's not particularly efficient. It requires iterating over the entire list, even though we only care about the even numbers. A smarter way to do this would be to use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers, and then find the sum of that list. Here's the updated code:</p> <pre><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\ntotal = sum(even_numbers)\nprint(total)\n</code></pre> <p>This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only contains the even numbers from the original list. It then uses the built-in sum function to find the sum of that list. This approach is much more efficient, as it avoids iterating over the entire list and only considers the even numbers.</p> <p>This is just a simple example, but it illustrates the importance of working smart in Python. By using built-in functions, list comprehensions, and other Python features, you can write code that is more efficient, more readable, and easier to maintain. By taking the time to learn these techniques and apply them to your code, you can work smarter instead of harder, and get more done in less time.</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/business-first/","title":"Why We Should Consider Business First as a Programmer","text":"<p>As a programmer, it can be easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of your work. You may be focused on writing clean, efficient code or implementing the latest technologies, without considering the business context in which your work will be used. However, it's important to remember that programming is not just an end in itself, but a means to an end. The ultimate goal of programming is to create software solutions that meet the needs of businesses and users. In this essay, we'll explore why we should consider business first as programmers, and how doing so can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/business-first/#understanding-the-business-context","title":"Understanding the Business Context","text":"<p>One of the most important reasons to consider business first as a programmer is to ensure that the software you create is aligned with the needs and goals of the business. This requires understanding the business context in which your software will be used. You need to understand the business model, the target audience, the competitive landscape, and the broader industry trends. By understanding these factors, you can create software that meets the specific needs of the business, rather than simply creating something that you think is technically impressive.</p> <p>For example, suppose you're working on a mobile app for a retail company. If you don't understand the business context, you may focus on creating flashy animations or implementing cutting-edge technologies, without considering the user experience or the specific needs of the retail company. However, if you take the time to understand the business context, you may realize that the most important thing is to create an app that's easy to use, with a simple checkout process and personalized recommendations. By putting the business first, you can create software that truly meets the needs of the business and its customers.</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/business-first/#prioritizing-business-needs","title":"Prioritizing Business Needs","text":"<p>Another reason to consider business first as a programmer is to ensure that you're prioritizing the most important business needs. In many cases, there may be competing priorities, such as performance, security, scalability, and usability. By understanding the business context, you can make informed decisions about which priorities to focus on, based on the business goals and user needs.</p> <p>For example, if you're working on a financial application, security may be the top priority, even if it means sacrificing some performance or usability. On the other hand, if you're working on a social media app, usability and scalability may be more important, as users will quickly abandon an app that's difficult to use or slow to load. By prioritizing business needs, you can create software that's not only technically sound, but also meets the most important needs of the business and its users.</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/business-first/#building-long-term-relationships","title":"Building Long-Term Relationships","text":"<p>Finally, considering business first as a programmer can help you build long-term relationships with clients and employers. By creating software that meets the specific needs of the business, you can demonstrate your value as a strategic partner, rather than just a technical resource. This can lead to more opportunities for collaboration and growth, as well as more job security and satisfaction.</p> <p>For example, suppose you're working as a freelance developer for a small business. By understanding the business context and prioritizing the most important business needs, you can create software that helps the business grow and thrive. This can lead to more work and referrals from the business, as well as a long-term relationship that benefits both parties.</p>"},{"location":"general-advices/business-first/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>In conclusion, considering business first as a programmer is essential for creating software solutions that truly meet the needs of businesses and users.

However, I didn't have a reason to use it until a series of bugs rained upon me when my 3rd &amp; 4th project comes along. Let's just say we all started the same way, we learned a new programming language when we get into this field, and we installed a compiler or engine on our machine (be it your own or one your company provides). You will never run into any problems with your first project. But when the second project comes in and it requires the same programming language. Things start to become troublesome, here's a list of symptoms that might have encountered:   </p> <ul> <li>The package/library installed on your first project collides with your second projects  </li> <li>Your second project requires a different version of the same engine/compiler as your previous ones.  </li> <li>Exporting the installed lib into a package file is a mess because it includes not only your previous project but also the sub-dependencies of that project.  </li> <li>Installing an additional version of your programming language can cause some confusion. Your machine might have trouble finding the correct interpreter/version of your programming language. You have to be a bit more careful when declaring the pathing on your machine.  </li> </ul> <p>What I'm trying to get at is that if we can control the version of the programming language and/or its dependencies, we will run into a lot fewer dependencies collision problems.</p> <p> note I admit, I did ran into all 3 problems in the first 2 years when I started working in the field. Initially the problem persists even after I fix them. A series of bugs began to appear, one after another. It's like I can cut the stem but the root remain. At the time I thought I was already exploring uncharted territory since I was the only one having that problem.  I still ran into this problem until I start to use docker. As you may or may not know, docker container is a tool that allow you to isolate environment for your software. This is the core component of any microservice architecture. It's similar to a virtual machine, isolated, separated and perfectly clean of unused packages.  Once I discovered docker, I used it pretty much anytime I can, from creating a development environment with a docker container and terminal into it with an IDE. Lots of fun, but also clunky and inefficient. </p> <p>Package Manager: A package manager is a tool that helps developers manage dependencies and packages for their projects. Popular package managers for different programming languages include npm for Node.js, pip for Python, and RubyGems for Ruby.</p> <p>With a package manager, developers can easily install, update, and remove packages and dependencies for their projects. This helps ensure that the project remains up-to-date with the latest versions of packages and dependencies and reduces the risk of compatibility issues. Additionally, package managers often include features such as package discovery, version tracking, and dependency resolution to help developers work more efficiently and effectively.</p>"},{"location":"version-control/intro/#how-should-we-do-it","title":"How should we do it?","text":"<p> note At the time I write this document, I've only used python and nodejs so I can only refer to those two.
